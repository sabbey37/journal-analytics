<h2>What is Journal Analytics?</h2>

<p>Journal Analytics allows users to connect site activity data obtained from their Google Analytics accounts with events posted by their team. Had a booth set up at a 5K event? Post it here! Submitted a blog post on multiple platforms? Post it here! Keep a journal of all the efforts you put into your buisness on and off the web using Journal Analytics. Journal Analytics displays these events so you can visualize how they affect activity on your site.</p>
