            <p>Google Analytics is a powerful tool to display users visiting your site, how they got there, and what's working on the web. However, there's a disconnect between these analytics and your work outside of the web.</p>
            <p>Our application connects realtime Google Analytics with additional data you supply. Had a booth set up at a 5K event? Post it here! Submitted a blog post on multiple platforms? Post it here! We will display these events so you can visualize how they affect your site traffic.</p>
            <p>Keep a journal of all the efforts you put into your buisness on and off the web.</p>
